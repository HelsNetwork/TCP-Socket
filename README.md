# TCP-Server


## Usage
Use git clone to install the folder. 
```
git clone https://github.com/hel4s/TCP-Socket.git
```

### NOTE: The client and server should be run in separate terminal windows, so they can communicate with each other.


Open two terminal windows and change the directory to the TCP-Socket folder. On one of the window, run:

```
python3 ./echo-server.py
```
On the second terminal window, run:
```
python3 ./client-server.py
```
